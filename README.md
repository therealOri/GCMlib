    GCMlib - A minimalistic and simple encryption library. For encrypting data using AES GCM mode. 
</h1>
<p align="center">
    GCMlib allows you to encrypt and decrypt strings of text via AES in GCM mode with a password derived key. Your encrypted data/strings can only be decrypted using the aformentioned key. You can use this for a variety of things from securing passwords, encrypting HWIDs and files. Making AES encryption a little bit easier!

# Updates
What has been updated as of | 12/31/22:

> - New KDF. Uisng Argon instead of scrypt.

<br />
<br />

# Installation
 > [Directly from here/this repo.]
```bash
[therealOri ~]$ pip install git+https://github.com/therealOri/GCMlib
```

or

> [From Pypi.]

# Code Examples
> If you would like to make this look better/more presentable. Please by all means make a pull request xD. I'm not the best with making things look great.

It is important to know that all functions will take 2 values in BYTES. The data to encrypt and the key. Make sure the data passed to the functions are in that order. Data first then Key.

The making of the "key" takes in a password (that you can make using [Genter](https://github.com/therealOri/Genter)). The key then gets used to encrypt your data.
> I am aware of the typo/incorrect import useage in the pypi readme. It will be fixed next release. (if I make a next release)

```python
import gcm


##---------Start---------##

#Encrypting
data = b'Hello World <3'
key_data = b'abcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcde'

eKey = gcm.keygen(key_data) #Returns bytes and will return "None" if what's provided is less than 100 characters.
save_me = base64.b64encode(eKey) #for saving eKey to decrypt later.

input(f'Save this key so you can decrypt later: {save_me}\n\nPress "enter" to contine...')
gcm.clear() #clears terminal or cmd/powershell window.

data_enc = gcm.stringE(data, eKey) #It is CRITICAL that you have the data you want to encrypt FIRST then the key.
gcm.clear()
print(data_enc) # Output is b64 encoded. --> eyJub25jZSI6ICJjQjhpWmc0MWhDWXBRVXdVdW53Q0pRPT0iLCAiaGVhZGVyIjogIlJXNWpjbmx3ZEdWa0lIVnphVzVuSUVkRFRXeHBZaTRnUkU4Z1RrOVVJRlJCVFZCRlVpQlhTVlJJTGlBZ2ZDQWdUV0ZrWlNCaWVTQjBhR1Z5WldGc1QzSnBJQ0I4SUNCaUoxeDRNVE5jZUdKaFhIaGpaVng0TVdWY2VHRTRYSGhsT1VOY2VHRmxKdz09IiwgImNpcGhlcnRleHQiOiAiZ2FDSjY4N2FGVjNMMEIyb01Ecz0iLCAidGFnIjogIkJBUjlmVzkzaWFESnUwckpSU2o3VEE9PSJ9

# Disclaimer
I am not liable or responsible for any data loss or destruction of any kind when using GCMlib. If you lose data and do not have backups then that is solely on you.
> This disclaimer mainly comes from me noticing that if what you are trying to decrypt is to large, it will just error. Idk what causes this or why as encrypting would work just fine.. So remember to be careful of what you encrypt and make sure to have plenty of backups.
